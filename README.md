# Fullstack Kanban Application

This is my first full stack application. <br/>
I built this project for practice and I wanted a full stack application to show in my portfolio.<br/>
I learned alot both about the backend and then connecting it to my frontend. <br/>
It gave me a good practice on handling state in ReactJS and also tested my Javascript skills.<br/>

It has all crud functionality implemented. <br/>
