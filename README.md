# Fullstack Kanban Application

This is my first full stack application. <br/>
I built this project for practice and I wanted a full stack application to show in my portfolio.<br/>
I learned alot both about the backend and then connecting it to my frontend. <br/>
It gave me a good practice on handling state in ReactJS and also tested my Javascript skills.<br/>
I used localStorage to display the right board on refresh and useContext for passing state down the component tree.<br/>
The site has a both a dark theme and light theme.

It has all crud functionality implemented. It both updates the backend and states so when you add board or task it renders instantly<br/>

## Tech Stack

Backend built with NodeJS Express and MongoDB.
Frontend built with ReactJS and SASS.

It has all CRUD functionality.<br/>
I used UseContext for state management.<br/>
You can create boards (project name) and than add tasks for that project and subtasks for each task.
You can then delete and edit boards, tasks and subtasks.

Click the arrow in the header and select Create New Board.
